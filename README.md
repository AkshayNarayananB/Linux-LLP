# Linux-LLP

### Hey There!
I'm building this repo as a reference to store my starter programs as I start learning Lower Level Programming. While I may later choose not to indulge a lot into kernel building, the code and explanation here will give the standard knowledge any OS / Embedded Programming course in a university will do.
